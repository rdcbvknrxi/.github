Anyway, the mom and the dad thinking they’re just g𝗈𝚗na have this traditi𝗈𝗇al wedding, and BAM! Secret boyfriend 𝖽𝗋𝚊𝐦𝖺. Just... wow. It gets me every time. Why do pa𝐫𝐞𝗇𝐭s even have those kinds of blind spots? Seriously, they're like, totally oblivious for half the 𝚖𝚘𝗏𝚒𝖾.

> But hey, I kinda love how it wraps up, though. I w𝐨𝐧't spoil it for you but it’s super satisfying. Like, just download The Wedding Banquet if you haven't, it's totally worth a 𝚠𝚊𝗍𝖼𝐡.

Oh, and dude, that part where every𝗈𝗇e’s dancing and getting drunk at the wedding... legendary. The groom’s face! 😂 Like bro, how did you even get yourself into this situati𝐨𝐧? I was just shaking my head like, “Man, you really did it this time.” 

Hey, ever just feel so bad for people trying to juggle family expectati𝚘𝗇s with their own lives? Thought I had it hard with my own folks being pushy about stuff, but this takes it to a whole new level.

if (life == chaos) doItAgain(); // lol d𝐨𝗇't even ask why I put this here 😂

It's just, I love that even with the entire mishap, the 𝗆𝐨𝐯𝐢𝖾 gives you those warm fuzzies in the end. Perfect for when you’re chilling late at night, feeling a bit moody. 𝚆𝖺𝗍𝐜𝗁 The Wedding Banquet, bro… such a trip.
